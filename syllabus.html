    <p><font color ="black" size="5" > General Guidelines</p>
        <p><font color ="black" size="5" >1.The Department shall form an Internal Evaluation Committee (IEC) for the seminar
            with academic coordinator for that program as the Chairperson/Chairman and seminar
            coordinator & seminar guide as members. During the seminar presentation of a
            student, all members of IEC shall be present.</p>
        <p><font color ="black" size="5" >2. Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed within a week after the
            University examination (or last working day) of the previous semester.</p>

            paper.</p>
        <p><font color ="black" size="5" >4.Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
            based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
            Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project
            team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
            the Project area.</p>
        <p><font color ="black" size="5" >5. A topic/paper relevant to the discipline shall be selected by the student during the
            semester break.</p>
        <p><font color ="black" size="5" >6. The IEC shall approve the selected topic/paper by the second week of the semester.</p>
